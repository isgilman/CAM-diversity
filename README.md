# CAM-diversity
 Figures and supplementary data for The CAM Lineages of Planet Earth (Gilman _et al. accepted_).
 - `Supplementary-Table-S3.csv`: estimations of the fractions of species expected to be capable of CAM in genera known to possess at least one CAM species
   - All Cactaceae and Crassulaceae species were hypothesized to be capable of CAM
 - `Supplementary-Table-S4.csv`: family-level CAM species diversity estimations made by summation of genus-level CAM species diversity statistics in `Supplementary-Table-S3.csv`
 
 Note that these numbers represent the _first attempt_ at estimating CAM species diversity in a systematic way. These numbers should be treated with caution proportional to degree each clade has been investigated. We hope to improve the accuracy and precision of these data with community input!
